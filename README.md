# Micro-eCommerce
Build a modern Micro-eCommerce Web App using Python, Django, Poetry, and Serverless Postgres. This project demonstrates a professional approach to creating a scalable, minimalist e-commerce platform using contemporary tools and practices.

To install packages and run various command shortcuts, we use [rav](https://github.com/jmitchel3/rav). Open `rav.yaml` to see the various commands available if you prefer to not use `rav`.
